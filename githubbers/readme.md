# How to add yourself as a GitHubber

1. Fork the repo
2. Edit githubbers/githubbers.json from YOUR repo (to ensure your icon shows up, use the same email you use for GitHub)
3. Create a pull request and wait for us to approve it
4. See the result at [http://cci-grads.github.com/githubbers/](http://cci-grads.github.com/githubbers/)

Why so difficult? The purpose of this directory is to both keep a list of CCI GitHubbers and to allow new GitHubbers to learn how to fork a repo and submit pull requests. With that knowledge, you can contribute to practically any project on GitHub!
